# ⚙️ Hand-Cranked Power Generator

A DIY mechanical-to-electrical power generator using optimized gear trains and a DC motor. This project is ideal for anyone interested in sustainable power generation, mechanical engineering, or just cool maker builds.

---

## 📐 Overview

This compact generator multiplies hand crank speed using compound gears to spin a DC motor fast enough to generate up to **10 Watts** of electricity. Perfect for low-power applications like lighting LEDs, charging small devices, or powering a mini fan.

## 🔩 Mechanical Design

### Gear Train Configuration

| Stage | Gear A (Input) | Gear B (Driven) | Speed Boost |
|-------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1     | 10cm / 40 teeth| 5cm / 20 teeth   | 2×          |
| 2     | 5cm / 20 teeth | 2cm / 10 teeth   | 2×          |
| 3     | 2cm / 10 teeth | 1cm / 5 teeth    | 2×          |

🌀 **Total Speed Boost:** 8×  
🕰️ Cranking at 60 RPM → DC motor spins at **480 RPM**

---

## ⚡ Electrical Setup

- **DC Motor:** Brushed 12V motor (~1000 RPM rated)
- **Output Voltage:** 9–12V
- **Current Output:** ~0.5–0.8A
- **Power Output:** Up to 10 Watts

### 🧷 Wiring

- Connect output terminals to:
  - LED strip or test load
  - USB step-down converter
  - Battery charging circuit
- Add diode to prevent backflow
- Optional capacitor for smoothing output

---

## 🛠️ Materials Required

- DC motor (12V brushed)
- Metal or plastic gears (ratios as listed above)
- Bearings for low-friction shafts
- Plywood/aluminum frame
- Flywheel (optional)
- Volt/Ammeter (optional)
- Crank handle
- Shaft couplers & mounting brackets

---

## 🚀 How to Build

1. Mount gears sequentially with supported axles.
2. Connect crank to the largest gear.
3. Secure gear train to the frame with minimal wobble.
4. Attach final gear to the DC motor shaft.
5. Wire motor output to desired load or storage.
6. Start cranking — feel the power!
